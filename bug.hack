This code has an error when it comes to large inputs. The recursive function calls itself with a smaller argument each time, until the base case (x == 0) is reached. However, this approach is inefficient and can lead to stack overflow errors for large values of x because it exceeds the maximum recursion depth allowed by the system. The stack overflow happens when the function calls itself too many times, exceeding the available memory on the call stack.
